# What is this about?

Well... the main goal of this project is to create a web page that generates random stories in a shakespeare esque format. 

In fact, the very source of the words and characters will be from a pseudo-shakespeare-story as is seen in this blog-post https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karpathy/char-rnn/master/data/tinyshakespeare/input.txt. In it Andrej Karpathy creates a 40 000 line story from different Shakespear's plays as a result of "The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks" (how ironic right?).

In effect, the random story that will be generated will be second-degree murder of the actual stories (sorry, not sorry).
