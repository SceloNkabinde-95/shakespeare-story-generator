# What is this about?

Well... the main goal of this project is to create a web page that generates random stories in a shakespeare esque format. 

In fact, the very source of the words and characters will be from a pseudo-shakespeare-story as is seen in this blog-post https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karpathy/char-rnn/master/data/tinyshakespeare/input.txt. In it Andrej Karpathy creates a 40 000 line story from different Shakespear's plays as a result of "The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks" (how ironic right?).

In effect, the random story that will be generated will be second-degree murder of the actual stories (sorry, not sorry).

# Okay, why are you doing this?

Uhmm... Coz I wasn't loved as a child. (Just kidding!)

I'm currently upskilling my web dev skills and I think I have the fundamentals figured out and so I want to prove that to myself. 

Additionally, coming from a data analytics background I think it'll be cool to show you guys that I have other skills sometimes (wink wink).

# Wow dude, you're so amazing! What inspired you?

I don't like to toot my own horn but I know I'm the best :)

(Takes a Zoolander serious face pose): I was inspired by the cjallenge on https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/Silly_story_generator#starting_point as I kept learning about Javascript and I thought "Wait a minute. I also recall using Markov Chains to create predictions in my other life, so why not use that to generate the stories of the great Shakespeare."

At that point I came across Pushpendra Singh's similar Markov Chain's project found here https://medium.com/@pushpendrasinghcod/text-generation-from-shakespeare-play-using-markov-chains-eee5bfcbb7a0, and then I knew that this has to be done. My hands are tied now, so here we go!
